## Use

A Python 3 interpreter is required to run this playbook. Most Linux distributions come with some version out of the box.

1. Download or clone this repository to your workstation.
2. **(optional)** Create and activate a virtual environment. On the repository's directory: `python3 -m venv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate`.
3. Upgrade Pip: `pip3 install --upgrade pip`
4. Install Ansible and other dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install required Ansible roles & collections: `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`
6. Run the playbook: `ansible-playbook workstation.yml --ask-become-pass`

**NOTES**
- The playbook uses privilege escalation to execute some tasks; the user that runs it needs to have the correct permissions (be a sudoer for example).
- If you are using Ubuntu you will need to install the packages `python3-pip` and `python3-venv` before step 2.

## Customization

### Skip or run specific tasks

If you need to, you can skip parts of this playbook or run only a subset of the tasks. Run this playbook specifying a set of tags using the `--tags` flag:

```
ansible-playbook workstation.yml --ask-become-pass --tags packages,docker,dotfiles
```

The tags available are: `packages`, `snaps`, `code` / `visual-code`, `fzf`, `direnv`, `interpreters` ( `pyenv` / `python`, `rbenv` / `ruby`, `fnm` / `node` ), `docker`, `dotfiles`.

You can avoid/skip certain tasks using the inverse flag `--skip-tags`.

### Provision a remote machine

You can provision a remote workstation using this playbook; the remote machine should be configured so you can access to it through [SSH](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-enable-ssh-on-ubuntu-20-04/).

Edit the inventory file _"inventory/local"_ in this repository:
```
# before
[workstation]
localhost ansible_connection=local

# after
[workstation]
<remote-workstation-ip/hostname> ansible_user=<remote-workstation-user>
```

Then run the playbook:
```
ansible-playbook workstation.yml
```

### Change configurations

You can change the configuration on _"vars/main.yml"_ to customize the installed packages, the versions of ruby to install and to use by default, etc:

```yaml
apt_packages:
  - htop
  - screen
  - steam
  - unzip

snap_packages:
  - spotify

ruby_versions:
  - 2.7.6
  - 3.2.0-dev
ruby_default_version: 2.7.6

dotfiles_repository: https://github.com/johndoe/dotfiles

```
